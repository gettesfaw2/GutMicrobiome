These are R-scripts are for the research projected entitled by “Gut microbiota patterns associated with duration of diarrhea in children under five years of age in Ethiopia” 
Clinical data(metadata) used in this study cannot be made freely available to protect the privacy of the participants, in accordance with the Danish Data Protection Act and European Regulation 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council (GDPR).

# There four are script associated in this project

1.	Diarrhea_Alpha_Beta_diversity_microbiome_analysis.R
   # This script contains the relative abundance analysis, alphadiversity analysis, betadiversity analysis, distance-based redundancy (db-RDA) analysis and logistic regregration analysis. 
  
3.	Phyloseq_CSS_import_16S.R
   # This R file used to import the Phyloseq object that used for the “betadiversity analysis, and distance-based redundancy (db-RDA) analysis”.
  
5.	Phyloseq_import_16S.R
   # This R file used to import the Phyloseq object that used for the “relative abundance analysis, alphadiversity analysis”. 
  
8.	Diarrhea_Differenatial_abundance_Microbiome_analysis.Rmd

  	# This R  markdown file contain the differential microbiome analysis using the DESeq2 and sparse partial least square discriminatory analysis (sPLS-DA).
